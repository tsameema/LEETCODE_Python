## Intuition
The intuition behind this code is to reverse the order of words in a given string. To achieve this, the code splits the input string into words, reverses the order of these words, and then joins them back together to form the reversed string.

## Approach
1. Initialize an empty list l to store individual words and a variable i to keep track of the start of a word.

2. Iterate through each character w and its index n in the input string s.

3. When encountering a space character ' ', it means the end of a word. Add the substring from i to n as a word to the list l, and update i to the next character index (i.e., n + 1).

4. If we reach the end of the string (i.e., n == len(s) - 1), add the last word (from i to n+1) to the list l.

5. After processing all characters, we have a list l containing individual words in the order they appeared in the original string.

6. Reverse the order of words in the list l using list slicing ([::-1]) and join them back together into a single string with spaces in between using ' '.join().

7. Return the reversed string.

## Complexity
### - Time complexity:
The code iterates through the input string s once to split it into words $(O(n))$, and then it iterates through the list of words once more to join them $(O(m)$, where m is the number of words). Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(n + m)$, but since the number of words is generally much smaller than the length of the string, we can simplify this to $O(n)$, where n is the length of the input string s.
### - Space complexity:
The code uses a list l to store words temporarily. In the worst case, if each character in the input string is a word (e.g., no spaces), the space used by l could be $O(n)$. Additionally, the space used to store the final reversed string is also $O(n)$. Therefore, the overall space complexity is $O(n)$.
