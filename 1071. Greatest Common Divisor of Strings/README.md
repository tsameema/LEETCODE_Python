## Overview
This code defines a class Solution with a method gcdOfStrings that takes two strings str1 and str2 as input and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the strings as described in the problem statement.

## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two strings. In this context, the GCD of two strings is a string that can be formed by repeating a shorter string a certain number of times to create the longer string. To solve this problem, we can check if there exists a common divisor string that can be used to generate both input strings.

## Approach
1. Convert both input strings, str1 and str2, to uppercase to make the comparison case-insensitive.
2. Check if the lengths of the two strings are within the valid range of 1 to 1000 characters. If not, return an empty string since the input is not valid.
3. Check if the concatenation of str1 and str2 is equal to the concatenation of str2 and str1. If they are not equal, it means that there is no common divisor, so return an empty string.
4. Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of the two strings. We do this by repeatedly taking the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number until one of the numbers becomes zero. The other number will be the GCD.
5. Once we have found the GCD of the lengths, we can extract a substring of str1 from index 0 to the length of the GCD and return it as the result.

## Complexity
### - Time complexity:
The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input strings. This is because the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD has a time complexity of **O(log(min(len(str1), len(str2)))).**

### - Space complexity:
The space complexity of this algorithm is **O(1)** because we are not using any additional data structures that depend on the input size.
