## Intuition
The problem asks us to determine if string s is a subsequence of string t. A subsequence is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the original string, but not necessarily consecutively. For example, if s = "abc" and t = "ahbgdc", then s is a subsequence of t because the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' appear in the same order in t.

To solve this problem, we can use a two-pointer approach. We'll initialize two pointers, one for s and one for t, and iterate through both strings simultaneously. If the characters at the current positions match, we'll advance both pointers. If they don't match, we'll only advance the pointer for t. If we can successfully iterate through the entire string s, it means that s is a subsequence of t.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, i and j, to 0, where i points to the current character in s, and j points to the current character in t.
2. Iterate through both strings while i is less than the length of s and j is less than the length of t.
Compare the characters at the current positions s[i] and t[j].
3. If they are equal, increment i to move to the next character in s.
4. In any case, increment j to move to the next character in t.
5. After the loop, check if i has reached the length of s. If it has, return True, indicating that s is a subsequence of t. Otherwise, return False.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(max(N, M))$, where N is the length of string s and M is the length of string t. We iterate through both strings once.

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$ since we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.
