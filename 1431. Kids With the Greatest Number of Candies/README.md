## Overview
This code defines a class Solution with a method kidsWithCandies that takes a list of candies and an integer representing extra candies as input and returns a list of booleans indicating whether each child can have the greatest number of candies in the group.

## Intuition
The problem asks us to determine if each child can have the greatest number of candies in the group by giving them some extra candies. We need to find a way to efficiently compute this for each child.

## Approach
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the maximum number of candies among all the children in the list. We will call this value max_candies.
2. Initialize an empty boolean list bool_list to store the results.
3. Iterate through the list of candies, and for each child, check if the sum of their current candies and the extra candies (candy + extraCandies) is greater than or equal to max_candies. 
4. If it is, append True to bool_list, indicating that this child can have the greatest number of candies; otherwise, append False.
5. Return the bool_list as the result.

## Complexity
### - Time complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is $$O(n)$$, where n is the number of children, as we iterate through the list of candies once.

### - Space complexity:
The space complexity is $$O(n)$$ because we create a boolean list of the same length as the input list of candies.
