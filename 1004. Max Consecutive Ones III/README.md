## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the longest subarray with at most k zeros in an array of 1s and 0s. One way to approach this is by using a sliding window technique. We can maintain a window such that it contains at most k zeros, and we keep expanding it until we reach a point where the number of zeros in the window exceeds k. At this point, we contract the window from the left side until the number of zeros in the window becomes less than or equal to k again. We keep track of the maximum window size encountered during this process.

## Approach
Here's the step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1. Initialize variables left, zero, and max_length to 0. left represents the left boundary of the sliding window, zero counts the number of zeros in the current window, and max_length stores the maximum window size.

2. Iterate through the input array nums using a for loop, and for each element nums[i], do the following:

    - If nums[i] is equal to 0, increment zero by 1 to count the zero.
    - Check if zero is greater than k. If it is, this means the window contains more than k zeros. In this case, we need to contract the window from the left side until the number of zeros in the window becomes less than or equal to k. To do this, use a while loop:
        - Check if nums[left] is equal to 0. If it is, decrement zero by 1 to update the count of zeros in the window.
Increment left to move the left boundary of the window to the right.
3. Update max_length with the maximum of its current value and the size of the current window, which is (i - left + 1).

4. Continue this process for the entire array.

5. After the loop finishes, return max_length, which represents the length of the longest subarray with at most k zeros.



## Complexity
- Time complexity:
The algorithm iterates through the input array once, so the time complexity is $O(n)$, where n is the length of the input array.

- Space complexity:
The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables, so the space complexity is $O(1)$.
