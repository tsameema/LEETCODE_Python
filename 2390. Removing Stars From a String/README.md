## Intuition
The problem appears to be about removing adjacent asterisk characters ('') from a given string until no adjacent '' characters remain. The idea is to process the string character by character and maintain a stack to keep track of the characters. Whenever we encounter a '*', we can pop the last character from the stack if it exists, effectively removing the adjacent pair. We repeat this process until we have processed the entire string.


## Approach
1. Initialize an empty stack to store characters.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string s.
3. For each character n:
    - If n is equal to '*', pop the last character from the stack if it is not empty (removing the adjacent pair).
    - If n is not '*', push it onto the stack.
4. After processing all characters in s, the stack will contain the characters with adjacent '*' pairs removed.
Convert the stack into a string by joining its elements together.
5. Return the resulting string as the answer.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
The algorithm processes each character in the input string once, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string s.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case, the stack can contain all the characters of the input string.
