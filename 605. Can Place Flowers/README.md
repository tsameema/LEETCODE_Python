## Overview
This code defines a Solution class with the canPlaceFlowers method to solve the problem. It handles edge cases and iterates through the flowerbed to determine if we can place the required number of flowers.

## Intuition
The problem asks whether we can place n flowers in a flowerbed such that no two adjacent spots have flowers. We need to design a function to determine if it's possible to achieve this while adhering to the given rules.

## Approach
We can solve this problem by iterating through the flowerbed and checking if each spot is available to place a flower. If a spot is available, we place a flower and decrement the count of remaining flowers (n). To determine if a spot is available, we need to check if the current spot and its adjacent spots are empty (i.e., equal to 0).

To handle edge cases when the flowerbed has a length of 1, we handle it separately, allowing us to place a flower if the spot is empty.

## Complexity
### - Time complexity:
 $$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the flowerbed.

### - Space complexity:
$$O(1)$$, as we use only a constant amount of extra space.
