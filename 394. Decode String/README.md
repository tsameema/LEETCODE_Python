## Intuition
The problem asks us to decode a given encoded string. The encoding is done using a pattern like "k[encoded_string]", where "k" represents the number of times the "encoded_string" should be repeated. To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the current state while iterating through the string. Here are the main intuitions for solving this problem:

1. We can use a stack to keep track of both numbers and strings. When we encounter a digit, we accumulate it to form a number, and when we encounter a letter, we accumulate it to form a string.

2. When we encounter an opening bracket '[', we push the current accumulated number and string onto the stack and reset the accumulators.

3. When we encounter a closing bracket ']', we pop the number and the previous string from the stack, and we repeat the current string the specified number of times (the popped number).

4. We continue this process until we have processed the entire input string, and the final result will be the decoded string.

## Approach
Here's the step-by-step approach to solving the problem:

1. Initialize an empty stack to keep track of numbers and strings.
2. Initialize two variables: current_num to accumulate digits and current_str to accumulate letters.
3. Iterate through the input string character by character.
    - If the character is a digit, accumulate it to form a number (current_num).
    - If the character is an opening bracket '[', push current_num and current_str onto the stack, and reset current_num and current_str.
    - If the character is a closing bracket ']', pop the number and the previous string from the stack, and repeat the current string the specified number of times.
    - If the character is a letter, accumulate it to form the current string (current_str).
4. After processing the entire input string, the stack will contain the decoded string.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
 The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string once.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is O(m), where m is the maximum number of nested brackets in the input string. In the worst case, if there are no nested brackets, the space complexity is O(n).
