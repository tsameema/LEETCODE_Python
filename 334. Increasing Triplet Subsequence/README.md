## Overview
This code defines a class Solution with a method increasingTriplet that takes the input array nums and returns True if there exists an increasing triplet subsequence, and False otherwise.

## Intuition
The problem asks us to find if there exists an increasing triplet subsequence in the given array nums. This means we need to find three elements (i, j, k) such that nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] and 0 <= i < j < k < len(nums).

One way to approach this problem is to keep track of two minimum values, left and middle, and update them as we iterate through the array. If we encounter a number greater than middle, we can conclude that we have found a triplet, and we return True.

## Approach
1. Initialize two variables left and middle to positive infinity (float('inf')).
2. Iterate through the nums array from left to right:
    - If the current element right is less than left, update left to right.
    - If left < right < middle, update middle to right.
    - If right is greater than middle, return True as we have found a triplet.
3. If we complete the loop without finding a triplet, return False.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
$$O(n)$$, where n is the length of the nums array. We iterate through the array once.

- Space complexity:
$O(1)$, as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
