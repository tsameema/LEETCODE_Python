## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the number of equal pairs of rows and columns in a given grid. To solve this, we can iterate through the grid and keep track of the rows and columns in a dictionary, where the keys are tuples representing the row or column values, and the values are the counts of how many times each row or column appears.
## Approach
1. Initialize two dictionaries, col and rows, to keep track of the counts of columns and rows, respectively.
2. Iterate through the grid using two nested loops. The outer loop iterates through the rows, and the inner loop iterates through the columns.
3. For each row and column, convert the values to a tuple and use it as the key in the respective dictionary (col or rows).
4. Increment the count associated with that key in the dictionary.
5. After populating both dictionaries, initialize a variable c to keep track of the count of equal pairs.
6. Iterate through the items in the rows dictionary. For each key-value pair, check if the key (representing a row) exists in the col dictionary.
7. If the key exists in both dictionaries, increment c by the product of the values associated with that key in both dictionaries, i.e., c += val * col[key].
8. Finally, return the value of c, which represents the count of equal pairs of rows and columns.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n^2)# where n is the number of rows or columns in the grid. This is because we iterate through the grid twice: once to populate the col dictionary and once to check for equal pairs. 

- Space complexity:
$O(n)$ as we use two dictionaries, col and rows, to store counts of rows and columns, and their space complexity is proportional to the number of rows or columns in the grid.
