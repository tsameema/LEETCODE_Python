## Intuition
The problem asks whether two given strings, word1 and word2, can be made equal by performing two types of operations:

    - Swap any two letters in word1.
    - Swap any two letters in word2.
Intuitively, we need to check if it's possible to transform one word into the other using these operations. To do this, we can compare the character frequencies and the unique characters in both words.

## Approach
Here's the approach to solving this problem:

1. If the lengths of word1 and word2 are not the same, we can immediately return False because they cannot be made equal by swapping characters.
2. Create two lists, list1 and list2, to store the unique characters in word1 and word2, respectively.
3. Create two dictionaries, dict1 and dict2, to store the frequencies of characters in word1 and word2, respectively.
4. Iterate through word1 and word2, adding unique characters to their respective lists and counting character frequencies using the dictionaries.
5. If the sets of unique characters in list1 and list2 are not the same, return False. This means that word1 and word2 have different sets of characters and cannot be made equal.
6. If the sorted lists of values (character frequencies) in dict1 and dict2 are not the same, return False. This means that the character frequencies in word1 and word2 do not match, and they cannot be made equal.
7. If none of the above conditions are met, return True, indicating that word1 and word2 can be made equal by swapping characters.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
$O(n)$, where n is the length of the input words. We iterate through both words once to build the dictionaries and lists. 

- Space complexity:
$O(n)$, as we store unique characters and their frequencies in dictionaries and lists.
