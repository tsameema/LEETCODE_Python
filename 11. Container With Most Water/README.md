## Intuition
The problem asks us to find the maximum area that can be formed by selecting two lines (vertical bars) from an array of heights. The width of the selected lines will be the difference in their indices, and the height of the shorter line will determine the height of the rectangle formed. To maximize the area, we need to consider different pairs of lines and calculate the area for each pair.

## Approach
1. Initialize two pointers, left and right, at the beginning and end of the height array, respectively. These pointers represent the left and right lines of the rectangle we are considering.

2. Initialize a variable max_area to store the maximum area found so far.

3. Use a while loop to iterate until left is less than right. This loop allows us to explore all possible pairs of lines.

4. Calculate the width of the rectangle by subtracting left from right. This is done with (right - left).

5.  the height of the rectangle as the minimum of the heights at height[left] and height[right]. This is done with min(height[left], height[right]).

6. Calculate the area of the rectangle by multiplying the width and height obtained in the previous steps.

7. Update max_area with the maximum value between the current max_area and the calculated area.

8.  the pointers: If height[left] is less than or equal to height[right], increment left by 1. Otherwise, decrement right by 1. This step ensures that we explore different pairs of lines.

9. Continue the loop until left is less than right.

10. After the loop finishes, return the max_area as the maximum area.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
The while loop runs in $O(n)$ time, where n is the number of elements in the height array. Within each iteration, we perform constant time operations. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(n)$.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity is $O(1)$ because we use only a constant amount of additional space to store variables (left, right, max_area, and the temporary variables for width and height calculations). We do not use any data structures that grow with the input size.
