## Intuition
The problem involves simulating the collision of asteroids in space. The asteroids are represented as positive and negative integers, where positive integers represent asteroids moving to the right, and negative integers represent asteroids moving to the left. When two asteroids collide, they may explode, and only the larger asteroid will continue moving in the direction of its original path.

One approach to solving this problem is to use a stack data structure to keep track of the asteroids as they move. We can iterate through the list of asteroids and perform the following steps:

1. If the current asteroid is a positive integer (moving to the right), we simply add it to the stack since it cannot collide with any previous asteroids.
2. If the current asteroid is a negative integer (moving to the left), we need to check for collisions with asteroids in the stack. We keep popping asteroids from the stack while they are positive (moving to the right) and have a smaller absolute value than the current asteroid. This simulates the collision, and the smaller asteroid gets destroyed. If we encounter an asteroid in the stack with the same absolute value as the current asteroid, both asteroids are destroyed. If we encounter a negative asteroid in the stack or an empty stack, we add the current asteroid to the stack since it survives the collision.

## Approach
Here's the step-by-step approach implemented in the provided code:

1. Initialize an empty stack stk to keep track of surviving asteroids.
2. Iterate through the list of asteroids asteroids.
3. For each asteroid x:
    - If x is positive, push it onto the stack.
    - If x is negative, handle collisions with asteroids in the stack:
        - While the stack is not empty, the top asteroid is positive, and its absolute value is smaller than -x, pop the top asteroid (collision occurs, and the smaller asteroid is destroyed).
        - If the stack is not empty and the top asteroid has the same absolute value as -x, pop the top asteroid (both asteroids are destroyed).
        - If the stack is empty or the top asteroid is negative (survived the collision), push x onto the stack.
4. After processing all asteroids, the stack will contain the surviving asteroids, which represent the final state after all collisions.
5. Return the elements in the stack as the result.

## Complexity
- Time complexity:
O(n), where n is the number of asteroids in the input list. We iterate through the list once, and each asteroid is processed in constant time.

- Space complexity:
O(n), in the worst case, all asteroids may survive and be stored in the stack.
